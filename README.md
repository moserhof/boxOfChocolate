## My momma always said programming was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.

That's exactly what this repo is: a delicious assortment of my programming learnings. There's tremendous value in writing down what you learn, it forces you to truly ponder and articulate the learning process.

Each programming _chocolate_ should* have the following included on each:

* The programming language used
* Documentation links
* Code comments (if viable)
* An interactive way to see the code being run i.e. Jupyter Notebook

I've always delighted in learning about software engineering and programming writ large. Ideally, this repo will be a magnum opus of work that will serve me in a variety of ways.

Not only is this repo proof of concept that I'm practicing the craft of what I learn, but more importantly, it's a valuable resource I can use if I ever need help or a refresher on a concept/problem I face in the real world.

__Thank you for reading, stay groovy!__

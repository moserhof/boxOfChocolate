## My momma always said programming was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.

That's exactly what this repo is: a delicious assortment of my programming learnings, distilled into nice understandable bites. Each folder will house a different programming aspect based on subject. To be as helpful as possible, I'll try to include the following:

* The programming language(__s__) used
* Documentation links
* Code comments
* Visual screenshots
* Live demos

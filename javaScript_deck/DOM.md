## What is the DOM?

The **Document Object Model** (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML, XML and SVG documents. It provides a structured representation of the document as a tree.

The DOM defines methods that allow access to the tree, so that they can change the document structure, style and content. The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them, and once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

_Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages_.
